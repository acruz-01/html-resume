    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Annalee Cruz. I was born January 3, 1982 which makes me 42 years old. 
       I was born in the Philippines but half of my life I lived and worked in California, USA. 
       I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from AMA Computer University in the Philippines 
       and bachelors degree in Technical Management focusing on Computer Networks from Devry University,
       Daly City, California. I have extensive experience in customer service in retail industry by
       holding varying job positions. I always wanted to work in the IT industry given that my educational 
       background and make a career of it.
    </p>

    <p>I'm currently live in the Philippines for over a year now and decided to move here permanently. 
       I'm seeking career opportunities that will allow me to work from home that can foster growth and 
       financial rewards. I'm highly motivated individual and not afraid to try new things. I welcome challenges
       and see it as learning tool to improve my self and skills. I love learning new things that can help me
       achieve my goals. I'm a team player and do my best to help my team ensure our team's success. I can also
       work as individual with minimal supervision. 
    </p>

    <p>In my sparetime, I tend to stay at home to relax with my 3 dogs, Eggnog, Eelo and Eden. Eggnog and Eelo are Golden Retrievers and Eden is a Shih Tzu.
       I attached some photos of them in this page. I'm a homebody by heart and my home is my sanctuary. I also love reading books as it allows me to explore
       explore and experience different emotions and places. I also love to travel and experience different culture
       and food. I believe traveling allows an individual to have an open heart and mind. My favorite sport is table tennis
       not many people know that it is a highly competitive sport. Playing table tennis allows me to relax and let go 
       of the tensions from work or personal. The sport has taught me and still teaching me strategies, coordination and
       skills do matter just like in our professional careers as individuals.
